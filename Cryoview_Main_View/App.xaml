<!-- There are two ways to start an application running:
    1. Use the StartupUri attribute in the app xaml.
    2. Remove the StartupUri attribute. Ctor the main window in the Application_Startup event.

<!-- By specifying Application attributes for the events, we don't need to override the base class application event handlers. -->
<!-- ShutdownMode implicitly shuts down the app when the last window in the app closes even if there is acurrently instantiated main window -->
